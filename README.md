# ML_Project
In this machine learning project, I analyzed a dataset of social media messages to predict their sentiment as either positive or negative. The project involved an introduction to the fundamental principles of machine learning and an exploration of key concepts necessary for understanding and implementing sentiment analysis algorithms.
